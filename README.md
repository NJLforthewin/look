# GabayLakad: Smart Navigation Stick for Blind People Using Arduino

**GabayLakad** is a smart assistive cane designed to improve the safety, mobility, and independence of visually impaired Filipinos. Powered by Arduino technology, it combines critical real-world features into a single device that is practical, affordable, and easy to use.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Traditional white canes provide limited functionality in dynamic environments. GabayLakad enhances these limitations with smart features, including obstacle detection, audio feedback, emergency alerts, and real-time GPS tracking.

### 🔑 Core Features

- **🔊 Audio Feedback**  
  Provides spoken alerts or sound cues for detected obstacles, direction changes, and system status—ideal for users who prefer auditory guidance over vibrations.

- **🧱 Obstacle Detection**  
  Ultrasonic sensors detect nearby objects and alert the user via vibration or audio warnings.

- **🌧 Wet Surface Detection**  
  Moisture sensors identify wet or slippery areas, warning the user to proceed with caution and avoid falls.

- **🛰️ GPS Tracking**  
  Automatically logs the user’s current location and sends updates to a secure online caregiver dashboard.

- **📱 GSM Emergency Alerts**  
  Sends SMS messages with GPS coordinates to caregivers during emergencies or distress.

- **💡 Automatic Night Reflector**  
  A light sensor triggers LED reflectors in low-light environments to enhance visibility and safety.

- **🌐 Caregiver Monitoring Dashboard**  
  Web-based dashboard where caregivers can securely log in, view real-time locations, and receive emergency notifications.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Arduino Uno / Nano**
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**
- **GPS Module (e.g., Neo-6M)**
- **GSM Module (e.g., SIM800L)**
- **Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)**
- **Moisture Sensor (for wet surfaces)**
- **Speaker / Buzzer (for audio feedback)**
- **Vibration Motor**
- **Web Stack: HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL**

## 🎯 Objectives

- Provide safer, more intelligent navigation for the visually impaired.
- Deliver timely warnings about physical hazards, including wet surfaces.
- Support remote caregiving through GPS tracking and emergency alerts.
- Enable users to confidently navigate during the day or night.

## 👥 Target Users

- Visually impaired individuals in both urban and rural areas.
- Caregivers and family members who need remote visibility of the user’s status.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `/arduino-code` — Code for obstacle, GPS, GSM, moisture, and audio modules.
- `/dashboard` — Secure caregiver login and monitoring system.
- `/docs` — Setup guides, wiring diagrams, and system schematics.

## 🚧 Future Enhancements

- Voice-guided turn-by-turn navigation using AI.
- Mobile app for easier caregiver access.
- Rechargeable battery with solar support.
